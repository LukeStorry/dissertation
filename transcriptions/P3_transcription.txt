LS:  This is the interview with participant three.
\\P3:  Hi!
\\LS:  What do your climbing sessions usually include?
\\P3:  A bit of a warm-up, then I do some slightly more difficult climbs that I still know I can do, and then I'll try some I'm not sure I can do or not, and then I'll end with a bit of an overhanging sessions, and then that's done.
\\LS:  OK, would you class your normal sessions as just fun, or more training-orientated?
\\P3:  Fun
\\LS:  How do you think using the app has impacted your climbing session?
\\P3:  It's made me think a bit more about when I'm climbing, what I'm doing. It also makes me slow down a little bit, and actually take the time to take my phone out of my pocket and actually just consider what I'm about to do.
\\LS:  Ok, so you've used the app on multiple sessions now, have you ever compared scores between sessions?
\\P3:  Yeah I have
\\LS:  And how has using the app on successive sessions impacted how you use it?
\\P3:  Being able to name the sessions, so you know which is which, was a useful addition that made that easier to do, but I'm not really going climbing for training, but it was interesting to see how they compare. It wasn't always easy to do though.
\\LS:  maybe an easier way of linking a climb with a previous one would be good then?
\\P3:  Yeah, or even maybe assigning a photo, because with just writing a description, it is still easy to mix it up
\\LS:  What about the video?
\\P3:  Yeah that's a lovely feature, but I'd need someone to record it, and I usually climb alone
\\LS:  What was your favourite aspect of using the app?
\\P3:  The stats. I loved the gamification, wanting to get the scores as high or as low as possible, that is quite good fun, because its like, ok how can I be better
\\LS:  ok yeah, so is that against yourself or others?
\\P3:  Just against myself by repeating a climb or between climbs yeah
\\LS:  What was your least favourite aspect of the app?
\\P3:  Having to stop and start each time, and having to... I guess I'm just really bad at turning the screen off by accident, or pressing stop when it's in my pocket
\\LS:  So if you had to suggest an improvement to the app, would that be it?
P3:  I guess the easiest improvement would be to add a key, or give  a simpler star rating or something, because saying is a high number good or bad, or what is expected for a smooth or dynamic climb's score. Being a bit of a noob climber, I don;t really know what some of the stats mean.
\\LS:  Yeah, I suppose the idea was for the climber can decide how to use it, and what the numbers mean
\\P3:  I guess just giving more of a definition, like this is what this score means
\\LS:  I had a question about whether you see the app as more of a gamification or as a training tool, but I think you've already covered a bit of that...
\\P3:  I like the idea of, this is what I achieved last session, lets see what I can do next session
\\LS:  Do you think the app has caused to helped improve your climbing at all?
\\P3:  Yeah, it's definitely made me think more about it, and how I can try to lower the numbers.
\\LS:  What specifically has it made you think more about?
\\P3:  I guess, technique, trying to think about what I can do to increase my smoothness, and be less dynamic, and be a bit more controlled.
\\LS:  So have you done drills effectively, using the score?
\\P3:  I just keep doing the same climb, there were a few times when the centre was quite empty and I could just do that
\\LS:  Nice. Any features you'd like to see extended, or added?
\\P3:  I suppose a bit more analysis... actually I dunno... It could be kind of cool if it said like "I think you did this here", but even then.. bouldering is too short for that. Actually yeah, more gamification stuff could be cool, a leaderboard, ways so you could be like "ha I'm better than you"
\\LS:  so to bring in more actual like social competition between users
\\P3:  yeah
\\LS:  Any further points you'd like to make?
\\P3:  Nope. I really like the idea, its a really good app!
L3: Cool, thank you very much
