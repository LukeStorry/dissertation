\chapter{Technical Background}
\label{chap:technical}

% A compulsory chapter,  of roughly $10$ pages}

% This chapter is intended to describe the technical basis on which execution of the project depends.  The goal is to provide a detailed explanation of the specific problem at hand, and existing work that is relevant (e.g., an existing algorithm that you use, alternative solutions proposed, supporting technologies).

% Per the same advice in the handbook, note there is a subtly difference from this and a full-blown literature review (or survey).
% The latter might try to capture and organise (e.g., categorise somehow) all related work, potentially offering meta-analysis, whereas here the goal is simply to ensure the dissertation is self-contained.
% Put another way, after reading this chapter a non-expert reader should have obtained enough background to understand what *you* have done (by reading subsequent sections), then accurately assess your work.

% You might view an additional goal as giving the reader confidence that you are able to absorb, understand and clearly communicate highly technical material.

non-climbing background
- video analysis for sports
acceleroometer data used elsewhere
mobile phone running apps using pedometer etc

\section{Previous Climbing-related HCI Research}


Various aspects of adding computer-interaction to climbing have been studied in recent years: - using projectors to illuminate and gamify the climbing wall (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2581139) - using wearables to analyse and assess competitors abilities (https://axivity.com/case-studies/climbax) - assisting route-setters (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22463006) - manufacturing custom lit holds to add variety to single routes (https://designawards.core77.com/interaction/51284/edge-an-interactive-training-wall-for-climbers) - using computer-vision to analyse the centre-of-mass of climbers, and thus technique https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167945707000395


climbing with HCI in general, various types

look up history? timeline

projector stuff

climbing wall - interactive weighted holds? - design concept?


moving onto non-wall stuff, lightweight
climbax study - uses metrics
climbax wristbands



\section{Current Climbing Technologies}
the kickstarter that failed

iphone store apps - apple watch

vertical life - outdoors climb-ticking-off app has started collabs with indoor gyms

Lattice / climbax


trying to develop a middle ground, something that everyone can use without spending money on a specific device, yet still can provide data more meaningful than just logging climbs.

nothing to visualise the climbs, no apps so far use recording or any video-analysis, before developing this app you could use an accelerometer to get some simple data (eg garmin's climbing setting), or get a mate to record you on your phone, but now linking that all together and making a historical record...






\subsection{Previous HCI Mobile UI Research}

app design research?
eg max-menu item stuff
