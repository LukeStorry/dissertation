\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, a massive thanks must go to my dissertation supervisor Peter Bennett, for both aiding me greatly in the formation of the initial idea, and providing invaluable support throughout the execution of the project.
I want to thank Beth, the department's Teaching Technologist, for lending me a second android phone, which greatly sped up development of the app.
To the three climbers who lent me hours of their time to test various iterations of the app, and the six climbers who enabled me to perform my final in-depth analysis: thank you!
And of course my unending gratitude to the Bristol climbing community, for providing responses to my surveys, performing countless beta-tests, giving me the much-needed feedback I needed to develop the app.
