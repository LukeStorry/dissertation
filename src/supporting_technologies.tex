\chapter*{Supporting Technologies}

% {\bf A compulsory section, of at most $1$ page}
% \vspace{1cm}

% \noindent This section should present a detailed summary, in bullet point form,
% of any third-party resources (e.g., hardware and software components)  used
% during the project.  Use of such resources is always perfectly  acceptable: the
% goal of this section is simply to be clear about how and where they are used, so
% that a clear assessment of your work can result.  The content can focus on the
% project topic itself (rather, for example, than including ``I used \mbox{\LaTeX}
% to prepare my  dissertation''); an example is as follows:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item I used the Java {\tt BigInteger} class to support my implementation
%       of RSA.
% \item I used a parts of the OpenCV computer vision library to capture
%       images from a camera, and for various standard operations (e.g.,
%       threshold, edge detection).
% \item I used an FPGA device supplied by the Department, and altered it
%       to support an open-source UART core obtained from
%       \url{http://opencores.org/}.
% \item The web-interface component of my system was implemented by
%       extending the open-source WordPress software available from
%       \url{http://wordpress.org/}.

\begin{itemize}
\item I used Unity to develop my app, as its simple UI builder, support for multiple mobile platforms and rich library of Asset addons made developing and iterating my designs much quicker and easier. \url{https://unity.com/}
\item I used the free NativeCamera (\url{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/native-camera-for-android-ios-117802}), NativeShare (\url{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/native-share-for-android-ios-112731}), NativeGallery (\url{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/native-gallery-for-android-ios-112630}), and SimpleFileBrowser (\url{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/runtime-file-browser-113006}) Unity Assets to add those features to my app without wasting time developing the code myself.
\item I used parts of the OpenCV Computer Vision Library to explore frame-by-frame video-analysis, mainly edge-detection and blob-detection.

\item I used an Android Mobile device supplied by the Department, as well as my own Android device, to help build and debug the app during development.

\end{itemize}
