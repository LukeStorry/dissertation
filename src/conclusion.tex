\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

% A compulsory chapter, of roughly 5 pages

\section{Main Achievements}
% Resummarise the main contributions and achievements, in essence  summing up the content.







\section{Project Status}
% Clearly state the current project status
% (e.g., ``X is working, Y is not'')
% and evaluate what has been achieved with respect to the initial aims and objectives
% (e.g., ``I completed aim X outlined previously, the evidence for this is within Chapter Y'').
% There is no problem including aims which were not completed, but it is important to evaluate and/or justify why this is the case.



original aims:
Must Have: Atleast 2 wizard-of-oz prototypes to test user interaction and preferences.
A final product that implements some of the features at a low-fi level. Some form of testing and analysis of both prototypes and the final product.
Full ethics and health-and-safety approval.


Should Have:
An analysis of the current needs and wants of both developing intermediate-level climbers.
A final product that fully works and is very useful for intended purpose.
Plenty of user testing to give both qualitative and quantitative results for both the prototypes and final design.

Could Have: Strong usage of User-centred-design techniques.
Usage of a very novel technology/technologies as part of the final product.
An excellent writeup analysing choices and mistakes made along the development process.
A final product that is ready for market.







\subsection{Future Plans}
% Outline any open problems or future plans.
% Rather than treat this only as an exercise in what you {\em could} have done given more time, try to focus on any unexplored options or interesting outcomes
% (e.g., ``my experiment for X gave counter-intuitive results,this could be because Y and would form an interesting area for further study'' or ``users found feature Z of my software difficult to use, which is obvious in hindsight but not during at design stage; to resolve this, I could clearly apply the technique of Smith [7]'').

Two directions came out of the interviews:
taking the app more in the training direction, adding more analysis and possibly re-visitng the CV-aided technique analysis.
Also the gamification, and social aspect of that, for instance turning the app into a literal game, with points scored per climb and online connectivity with friends.
