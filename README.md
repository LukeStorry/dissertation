### Abstract

Climbing is a popular and growing sport, especially indoors, where climbers can train on man-made
routes using artificial holds. Both strength and good technique is required to successfully reach the top
of a climb, and often coaches work to improve technique so less strength is required, enabling a climber
to ascent more difficult climbs.

Various aspects of adding computer-interaction to climbing have been
studied in recent years, but there is a large space for research into lightweight tools to aid recreational
intermediate climbers, both with trickier climbs and to improve their own technique.

In this project, I explored which form of data-capture and output-features could improve a climber’s
training, and analysed how climbers responded to viewing their data throughout a climbing session, then
conducted a user-centred design to build a lightweight mobile application for intermediate climbers.

A variety of hardware and software solutions were explored, tested and developed through series of
surveys, discussions, wizard-of-oz studies and prototyping, resulting in a system that most closely meets
the needs of local indoor boulderers given the project’s time scope.

* I spent over 60 hours conducting in-field observations of climbers interacting with various proto-
types.

* I iteratively developed an interactive mobile app that:
  * can record, graph, and score the acceleration of a climber, as both a training tool and gamifi-
cation incentive for good technique
  * can link a video recording to the acceleration graph, to enable frame-by-frame inspection of
weaknesses
  * is fully approved and distributed on the Google play Store and currently being regularly used
by 15 local climbers.


* I wrote over 1000 lines of C# source code, with a further 20, 000 lines of Unity code-files defining
the graphical interface.

* I conducted a final usability study, comprising a thematic analysis of forty minutes’s worth of
interview transcripts, to gain a deep understanding of the app’s impact on the climbers using it,
along with its benefits and limitations.
